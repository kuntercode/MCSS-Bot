# MCSS Bot (Minecraft Server Starter Discord Bot)
MCSS is a bot that's allows you to remotely start your Minecraft server through your Discord server. This works thanks to two libraries: Pycord and mcstatus.

## Installation
The most stright forward way to get the bot is just to download the EXE file found at the releases page and put it inside your server folder (in the same folder where your start script is).
If you want to run the bot using Python then just download the main.py file from the source code (no other necessary files required, expect Pycord and mcstatus installed of course).

## Configuring and running the bot


To start your server you can use the /startserver command, the bot will first check if the server is already running to prevent launching the server multiple times.
